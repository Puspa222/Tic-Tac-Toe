## Introduction

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built to enhance my Python skills and explore GUI development with Tkinter. It's a two-player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" or "O".

## Features

- Interactive GUI using Tkinter
- Two-player mode
- Real-time updates of the game state
- Win and draw detection with alert messages

## Installation

To run this game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```
3. **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Starting the game:**
   - Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file.
   - A window will open with a 3x3 grid and a label indicating whose turn it is ("X" or "O").

2. **Playing the game:**
   - Players take turns clicking on the buttons in the grid to place their mark ("X" or "O").
   - The game will automatically detect a win or a draw and display a message.

## Code Overview

### Main Components

- **Initialization:**
  - The main window and frame are set up using Tkinter.
  
- **Game State:**
  - `xstate` and `zstate` lists keep track of the positions marked by "X" and "O" respectively.
  - `turn` variable to keep track of the current player's turn.
  
- **Functions:**
  - `checkplace(xstate, zstate, p)`: Returns "X", "O", or "" depending on the state of the position `p`.
  - `checkwin(state)`: Checks if the given state has a winning combination.
  - `game_end(winner)`: Displays the winner or draw message and ends the game.
  - `checkdraw(xstate, zstate)`: Checks if the game is a draw.
  - `fillboard(p)`: Updates the game state based on the position clicked and switches turns.
  - `update_board()`: Updates the UI to reflect the current game state.
